# codeblock

Package built on top of flutter_highlight for more control over how the code itself is displayed

## Getting Started

Import ``package:codeblock/codeblock.dart`` and build a ``codeblock`` object, initialising it with all the same parameters as ``flutter_highlight`` [refer this package](https://www.pub.dev/packages/flutter_highlight)

To set the decoration for the codeblock, use function ``codeblock.setDecoration(Boxdecoration)``. This will set the decoration as you see fit
